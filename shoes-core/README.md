# shoes-core

This is the primary, backend-agnostic implementation of shoes.  This gem is
intended for use with any Shoes backend, and defines the interactions between
the DSL and the backend.

`shoes-core` is also responsible for installation of the main `shoes`
executable and `shoes-picker` executable for choosing a Shoes backend.

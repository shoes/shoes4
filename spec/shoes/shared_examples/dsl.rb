# Shared examples for Shoes::App and Shoes::Slot (flow and stack).
# If DSL methods can be called with multiple number of arguments,
# and if they set certain defaults, then that what needs to be tested
# here.
# There are individual specs for the different Shoes elements, so
# we don't need to test how they work in details. Here we just test that
# the DSL methods construct elements correctly.

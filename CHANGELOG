4.0.0.pre3 (199 commits)
------------------------

New features (1)
----------------

* In pre2 we updated our gem layout and found a few things we didn't like.
  pre3 is now shaped how we expect to hold through 4.0!

  * shoes -- Now a meta-gem with the default installation as dependencies. It
    contains no code of its own (any shared code goes in shoes-core).
  * shoes-core -- The DSL and supporting code to share between Shoes backends
  * shoes-swt -- The first Shoes backend, based on SWT + JRuby
  * shoes-package -- Shoes packaging logic, separated to avoid pulling
    unneeded gems along in packaged apps
  * shoes-highlighter -- Extracted syntax highlighting from Hackety-Hack
  * shoes-manual -- Extracted content and display for Shoes manual

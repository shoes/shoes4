class Shoes
  # This is the superclass for creating custom Shoes widgets.
  #
  # To use, inherit from {Shoes::Widget}. You get a few magical effects:
  #
  # * When you inherit from {Shoes::Widget}, you get a method in your Apps to
  #   create your widgets. The method is lower- and snake-cased. It returns
  #   an instance of your widget class.
  # * Your widgets delegate missing methods to their app object. This
  #   allows you to use the Shoes DSL within your widgets.
  #
  # @example
  #   class SayHello < Shoes::Widget
  #     def initialize word
  #       para "Hello #{word}", stroke: green, size: 80
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   Shoes.app do
  #     say_hello 'Shoes'
  #   end
  #

    # Delegate missing methods to app, so you can use the Shoes DSL

          # hand it over in #initialize but that would break the interface
          # and people would have to set it themselves or make sure to call
          # super so for not it's like this.

# This file uses the after gem, which you probably haven't heard of (yet)
# It basically works like Class.after :method do ... end
# So for every instance of Class, after method is executed the block you
# gave it is executed.
# Here it is used to redraw the application, after specific methods are called.
# So that everything belonging to the aspect of redrawing is in one file.
# There will be more documentation up here: https://github.com/PragTob/after_do
# soon :-)

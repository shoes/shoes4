1. Fork the repository and clone your fork, or

        C:\tmp> git clone git://github.com/shoes/shoes4.git

2. Install a [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) and [JRuby](http://jruby.org) (Windows Executable)

3. Set up your local environment

        C:\tmp\shoes4>jruby --1.9 -S gem install json -v '1.6.1'

Refer to the [RubyInstaller DevKit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) if you are having issues building native gems. You might be forced to download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) if your system is missing GCC or make.

Running Specs
-------------

Shoes 4 is developed in a TDD style. You should be running the specs :)

There are rake tasks for running specs. Some examples:

    $ rake spec                # Run all the specs
    $ rake spec:shoes          # Run the specs for the Shoes DSL
    $ rake spec:swt            # Run the specs for the Swt implementation
    $ rake spec[Shape]         # Run all the specs for Shape
    $ rake spec:shoes[Shape]   # Run just the DSL specs for Shape

**Note:** For Windows, `C:\tmp\shoes4>jruby --1.9 -S rake spec`
    
Running a Shoes App
-------------------

Shoes 4 comes with a command-line app runner. Just pass it the filename of your Shoes app.

    $ bin/swt-shoooes samples/simple-sound.rb

**Note:** For Windows, `C:\tmp\shoes4>bin\swt-shoooes samples\simple-sound.rb`

Want to contribute?
-------------------
That's awesome, thank you! 

You can go ahead an try to fix one of our [issues](https://github.com/shoes/shoes4/issues).

Also there is a list of samples that already work at samples/README, along with all the other samples. You can try to get a new sample to run. 

With all you do, please make sure to write specs as shoes4 is developped TDD-style (see the [Running Specs](https://github.com/shoes/shoes4#running-specs) section above). So make sure that you don't break any tests  :-)

If you feel unsure about testing or your implementation just open an issue or a pull request. We're happy to help you get your contribution ready to be merged in order to help build shoes4!

Running Specs
-------------

Shoes 4 is developed in a TDD style. You should be running the specs :)

There are rake tasks for running specs. Some examples:

    $ rake spec                # Run all the specs
    $ rake spec:shoes          # Run the specs for the Shoes DSL
    $ rake spec:swt            # Run the specs for the Swt implementation
    $ rake spec[Shape]         # Run all the specs for Shape
    $ rake spec:shoes[Shape]   # Run just the DSL specs for Shape
